This study analyzed if familiarity with mobile financial services would positively influence the likelihood of participating in the stock market using logistic regression models. This study was inspired by the phenomenon in 2020 where the volume of traded stocks and the number of new trading accounts increased significantly when stimulus checks were given. To be more specific, as the amount of the stimulus check was small ($1200), I hypothesized that there would not have been that much participation in the stock market if no-fee, no-minimum trading brokerage/apps (such as Robinhood) were not available to lower the investing barriers for millenials.
